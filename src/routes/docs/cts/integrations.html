<h1>Integrations with Neko-CLI</h1>

<h2>Integrations with NPM</h2>
<p>
	Neko-CLI is fully integrated with NPM, the leading package management platform for JavaScript. By using NPM, developers can easily install and manage all necessary JavaScript dependencies directly within their Neko-CLI project. Whether you're developing a new feature or updating an existing module, Neko-CLI seamlessly supports dependency management through NPM, ensuring efficient version management and smooth interactions between packages.
</p>
<p>
	NPM offers a vast ecosystem of open-source packages, making it the go-to choice for JavaScript developers worldwide. With Neko-CLI, you benefit from the stability and reliability of NPM's package registry, along with the convenience of installing dependencies directly into your Neko-CLI environment. This integration ensures that developers can maintain a clean and organized project structure while leveraging the latest JavaScript technologies.
</p>

<h2>Integrations with Yarn</h2>
<p>
	Yarn is a modern package manager that provides advanced features like deterministic caching and offline installation. Neko-CLI integrates smoothly with Yarn, allowing developers to manage their dependencies with greater efficiency and reliability. Yarn's cache mechanism ensures that once a package is downloaded, it remains cached for future use, speeding up installation times and reducing the bandwidth required for subsequent installs.
</p>
<p>
	This integration allows Neko-CLI users to experience improved build times and enhanced performance, as Yarn efficiently manages package installations and updates. With Yarn, Neko-CLI can offer a more streamlined development workflow, reducing the risk of encountering compatibility issues and ensuring that dependencies are always in sync with the project requirements. This makes Neko-CLI an ideal choice for developers who prioritize speed, efficiency, and stability in their build processes.
</p>

<h2>Integrations with PNPM</h2>
<p>
	PNPM is known for its lightweight and fast package management approach. Neko-CLI supports PNPM, allowing for both efficient dependency management and scalable project builds. PNPM’s unique algorithm ensures that only the dependencies used by a project are installed, avoiding duplication and reducing the overall package size. This results in faster builds and more efficient use of system resources, making it a great choice for Neko-CLI developers.
</p>
<p>
	Integrating with PNPM, Neko-CLI benefits from improved build performance, especially for larger projects. PNPM’s ability to handle a large number of dependencies efficiently without bloating the project’s size is particularly beneficial for Neko-CLI, where developers often deal with numerous interdependencies and complex setups. The combination of PNPM’s lightweight nature and Neko-CLI’s powerful scripting capabilities ensures a smooth and responsive development environment.
</p>

<h2>Integration with Neko.Rock</h2>
<p>
	Neko-CLI also integrates seamlessly with Neko.Rock, an advanced resource management platform for games and virtual environments. This integration enables Neko-CLI users to control and optimize game resources in a highly efficient manner. With Neko.Rock, developers can easily configure and update game content, manage resources in real-time, and ensure a better user experience.
</p>
<p>
	By integrating with Neko.Rock, Neko-CLI provides powerful tools for managing game assets and their integration into the Neko-CLI system. This enables developers to streamline their game development processes, from asset management to in-game content updates. The combination of Neko-CLI's automation features and Neko.Rock's resource management capabilities makes it easier for developers to maintain high-quality game environments and deliver engaging player experiences.
</p>
